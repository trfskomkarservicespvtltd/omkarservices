    <h1>How to Earn Fixed Monthly Returns in India – A Safe Approach</h1>
    <p><strong>Published by:</strong> Omkar Enterprises | <strong>Date:</strong> May 2025</p>

    <h2>Why Fixed Monthly Income is Growing in Demand</h2>
    <p>Salaried individuals, small business owners, and retirees often need a <strong>reliable source of monthly cash flow</strong>. Traditional savings options like fixed deposits offer security but lack high returns. That’s where <strong>secure investment plans</strong> come in.</p>

      <li><strong>₹1,00,000+ Plan</strong>: Earn 10% monthly – notarized agreement + PDC</li>
    </ul>
